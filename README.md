## Description
** for the first one `ques1.js` The
function splits the input string into an array of characters. Then, it iterates through each character, checking if it's uppercase. If it is, it converts it to lowercase. Finally, it joins the characters back into a string and returns it.

** for the second one `ques2.js` the unction first determines the start and end points for generating the array by finding the minimum and maximum of the two input numbers. Then, it iterates from the start to the end point, pushing each number into the result array. Finally, it returns the generated array.

** and finally for the third question`ques3.js` to implement a function that filters out prime numbers from an array, we can use a helper function to check if a number is prime, and then apply this function to each element of the array and  my code tests it out as you can check
